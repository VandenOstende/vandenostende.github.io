# Feature Request â€” Report Generation for Top Waste Removal Clients

## Summary  
Add a feature to generate a report showing which client submitted the most waste removal requests. This helps identify the most active or high-volume clients.

## Motivation  
Currently, there is no easy way to see which clients are responsible for the most waste removal activity. This report would support business insights, client relationship management, and operational planning.

## Proposed behavior  
- A new report option is added to the dashboard or reporting module: **"Top Waste Removal Clients"**.
- When selected, the system generates a ranked list of clients based on the number of waste removal requests submitted.
- The report includes:
  - Client name
  - Total number of requests
  - Optional: total volume removed (if available)
- The report can be filtered by date range and location.
- Export options: CSV, PDF

## UI details  
- Report title: "Top Waste Removal Clients"
- Filters:
  - Date range picker
  - Location selector (optional)
- Table columns:
  - Rank
  - Client name
  - Number of requests
  - Volume (optional)
- Export button: "Download report"

## Edge cases & validation  
- If no data is available for the selected filters, show a message: "No waste removal requests found for the selected criteria."
- Handle clients with identical request counts by sorting alphabetically.
- Ensure performance is acceptable for large datasets.

## Acceptance criteria  
- [ ] New report option is available in the dashboard or reporting module  
- [ ] Report shows ranked list of clients by number of waste removal requests  
- [ ] Filters work correctly and update the report dynamically  
- [ ] Export to CSV and PDF works as expected  
- [ ] Empty states and errors are handled gracefully

## Notes for implementation  
- Use existing request data from the backend to aggregate by client.
- Consider caching or pagination for performance if the dataset is large.
- Ensure client names are consistently formatted to avoid duplicates.

## Original request (translated)  
"Add feature to generate report for seeing who did the most waste removal requests (biggest client)."
